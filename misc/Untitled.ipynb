    "* Can you explain how a global index works vs index free adjacency. I understand index free adjacency basically means there is a physical pointer in each record to associated other records via either a linkedlist/doubly linked list. Global index that other graph databases use means that they have to do a brute force scan of everything or have some sort of external index? \n"

A handler can be set up to intercept deletion of a node and instead simply mark that node as logically deleted (or in a more sophisticated manner, move the node “back in time” by creating timestamped archive relationships). I’m having a hard time visualizing how this is implemented \n"
